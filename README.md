# kubectl-nv

Kubectl NV plugin, a tool for managing NVIDIA objects on a kubernetes cluster. 
The kubectl-nv plugin is based on [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/), meaning, once installed into the user’s $PATH it will become part of the kubectl command line. As “kubectl nv”.

Currently, when a user faces a malfunction on their kubernetes cluster, users are directed to the [documentations page](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/troubleshooting.html) where they are asked to run multiple commands, and if those commands fail to expose the root cause, users are asked to run a must-gather bash script and send the resulting files to support for analysis.  With the kubectl nv plugin, users will be able to troubleshoot GPU nodes and clusters from a single command line tool, with customized options, making it easier for them to locally troubleshoot, and if given the case, to produce the files once generated by must-gather.

The kubectl plugin will provide the following troubleshooting commands:

## adm

### must-gather

```bash
kubectl nv adm must-gather --help
